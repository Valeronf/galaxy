# Galaxy

Space game galaxy build with python/kivy.

## Description

I have built this game during my python udemy-course.This application was initially written in a two-dimensional format, then with the help of projections, a three-dimensional format was created (this approach significantly simplified the development of animation and motion). The ship moves along a grid (actually, the grid moves), and the player's task is to stay on the white-marked lanes, gaining points by moving along them. If the player goes beyond the white area, they lose, their maximum score is recorded, and they can start over.
